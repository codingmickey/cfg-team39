## ‚ö†Ô∏è The issue
Hunger is not a natural disaster, it is a man made one to a large extent. 20+ lakhs of people die in India every year because of hunger. Hence, it is our duty to eradicate it. Bangalore Food Bank works in this direction. The problems faced by them are the lack of awareness and not easier ways to donate in a nutshell. So, we worked to create a solution towards this.

## ‚ú® Our Magic solution
1. We have created a feature where individuals or organizations can start their own campaigns.
2. We have generated QR code for the website, so it is more easily accessible as we can easily promote the cause through social media via banner and code.
3. We have created email verification sign-up.
4. For the future we plan on providing a token of appreciation to every donor via email
